## Test Data
<img align="right" width="250" height="300" src="docs/img/telegraf-mascot-2.png">

Some configs make use of example data which is provided under the [data directory](https://github.com/InfluxCommunity/Telegraf_Configs/tree/master/data). When community members contribute configs its worth adding testdata here when appropriate.
